## Introduction 

My name is Lucas Cullen, I am a .Net developer with a mathematical background, with a strong understanding of design patterns and cryptographic algorithms.  I am to use techniques from discrete maths to write provable code. In my spare time, I attend a lot of the .Net, Azure, Agile and ALM meetups in Brisbane.  

Recently I have been freelancing and working on my own open source projects.
